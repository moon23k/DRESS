## Dialog Generation to Avoid Boring Conversations
 
Dialogue Generation is the task of creating an appropriate response for a specific utterance. In the training session for this task, model learns how to generate the most appropriate answer based on utterance-response paired datasets. However, dialogue generation model tends to frequently create general answers that would be appropriate in any situation. This is because the more common answers are, the less likely they are to be wrong. And this make the model looks boring. To mend this problem, this repo presents simple method to **A**void **B**oring **C**onversations by combinibng two loss functions.
